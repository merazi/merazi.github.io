title: New Name, Same Great Tool: PySite is Now BlogCraft!

Hey everyone, exciting news!

I'm thrilled to announce that **PySite**, my trusty static site generator, is getting a new name: **BlogCraft**.

### Why the New Name?

It came to my attention that another Python package shares the name `pysite`. To avoid any confusion and give this project a more distinct identity, I decided a rebrand was the way to go. I feel "BlogCraft" better captures the spirit of the tool—crafting simple, beautiful blogs with ease.

### What Does This Mean for You?

The git repository and all the documentation have been updated with the new name. The core functionality of the tool remains exactly the same.

If you happen to stumble upon any lingering references to "PySite" in the code or docs, I'd be very grateful if you could open a pull request. Your contributions help make BlogCraft better for everyone!

I've also bundled in a few quality-of-life improvements to make your experience even smoother.

Hope you enjoy the changes.

Happy hacking! 🍎
