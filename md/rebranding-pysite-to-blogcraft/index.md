title: Rebranding Pysite To Blogcraft
date: 2025-12-21

Hello everyone! Just a quick announcement:

My **PySite** static website generator has been rebranded to "blogcraft".

The reason of the change is to avoid confusion with another python package also named "pysite": https://pypi.org/project/pysite/

This change has been applied to the git repository already, making sure the documentation is also updated... If any of you finds any instances of "pysite" in my code or documentation is most likely because I missed it, please send a PR.

Hope this tool is as useful to you as it is to me, also added some small quality of life improvements.

Happy hacking! 🍎
