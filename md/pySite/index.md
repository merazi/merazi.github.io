# Pysite

I remade my website! (Again...)

But this time I built the static website generator myself, with Python.

It's called "Pysite", and it's very easy to use.

You just get it from my github: https://github.com/merazi/blogcraft and follow the instructions.

Then generate your website with these simple steps:

- Step 1: Create your config.json file.
- Step 2: pysite new new-post
- Step 3: pysite build
- Step 4: Profit

You can host it in something like Github pages, just keep in mind the directory you want to publish is the one that says "public_dir" in the config.json file.

Have fun! 🍎
