                Hello everyone! Today I wanted to share something not many people know.

                There‚Äôs a music player available for GNU/Linux distros named ‚ÄúAudacious‚Äù, and it suppors the skins made
                for another music player called Winamp! I‚Äôll show you how to install them.
            </p>

            <h2>Getting the skins</h2>

            <p>
                First you need to get some skins. The best place to find them is definitely <a
                    href="https://skins.webamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skins.webamp.org</a>.
            </p>

            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JF4wbLN.jpeg" alt="Winamp skin example"
                style="max-width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:1em auto;"></img>

            <h2>Installing the skin</h2>

            <p>
                Once you have a skin you like, open it and you‚Äôll see the ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù option at the bottom.
            </p>

                style="max-width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:1em auto;">


            <p>
                Once your skin is downloaded, just open Audacious and drag your skin into the application, it will get
                installed automatically, and you can even delete the file you downloaded as AUdacious won‚Äôt need it
                anymore.

                That was super easy!

                I installed a peugeot skin since I like peugeot cars lol.

            <p>
                Hopefully I won't forget to record a video of the process, stay tuned! </p>

            <p>
                Thanks for reading. üçé
